To create a book translation without using GPT or human translators, you'll need to use alternative machine translation systems and tools. Here's a practical approach:
Alternative Machine Translation Options:

Open-source translation tools like:

DeepL Translator (high-quality translations for many languages)
Microsoft Translator
Amazon Translate
Linguee (reference resource)


Self-hosted translation software:

Argos Translate (open-source offline translation library)
LibreTranslate (free and open-source machine translation API)
Moses (statistical machine translation system)



Translation Process:

Prepare your book text:

Convert your book to a digital format (plain text, PDF, EPUB)
Split the text into manageable chunks


Use API-based translation:

Most translation services offer APIs for processing large volumes of text
You can write scripts to send chunks and receive translations


Post-processing:

Review for formatting consistency
Reassemble the translated chunks
Convert back to your desired book format
